        <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>I am a student and was also a student even before joining Moringa school.
             i am looking forward to learning more and knowing more from my friends and TM here in Moringa.
             So far I have learnt knew things and looking forward even to learn extra new things during the curse process.As for my background in computing,I can say that
             i know abit of its oprations as compared to what I have seen is taught in Moringa.</p>
          <p>I always believe I can and always focus in things I do and so with that and also my Passion in computing I saw it more than possible to start a programming class.
